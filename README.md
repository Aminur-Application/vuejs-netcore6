# ASP.NET Core Vue Starter

The repository contains an ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue.js starter template. The template runs on ASP.NET Core 6.0, vue 3 and vuetify 3(beta) with a new plugin based architecture allowing developers to interactively scaffold a new project with just a one command.

This template has been cloned from software-ateliers asp.net core 5.0 and vue 2 and repurposed to work with core 6 and vue 3.
